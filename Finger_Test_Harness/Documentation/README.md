## Finger Test Harness

### Description

A simple little device to get you introduced to the world of InMoov.

Once this is completed it should get you going easily to comprehend how to use an Arduino, a servo, and a robot finger.

### BOM

(1) Arduino Uno

(1) Servo (recommended is HK15298B but even the Parallax Standard Servo (#900-00005) will work)

(1) Braided Fishing Line (50lb-200lb test) approximately 12"-16"/30.48cm-40.64cm

(1) USB cable type A/B

All the printed parts.

Miscellaneous Bolts/Nut (3mm)

Miscellaneous FIlament (3mm)

### Instructions
1. Print FingerindexV2.stl with an infill of 30%, 1 shell, no support, no raft.
2. Print FingerTesterV2.stl with an infill onf 30%, 1 shell, no support, no raft.
3. Print RobRingV1.stl with an infill of 30%, 1 shell, no support, no raft.
4. Redrill and clean the side hinge holes with a 3mm drill.
5. Redrill and clean the inside hinge holes with either a 3mm or 3.5mm drill.
6. Depending on the material you have used to print there is different ways to glue the parts together. If you have PLA prints, a two components epoxy glue is really good but you can also use UHU glue. If you have printed in ABS, you can use epoxy, UHU glue but what works the best is acetone.
